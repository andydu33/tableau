Brannboll Stencil is a script sport typeface.
The baseball-style lettering was drawn by Måns Grebäck in 2020.

It is a specialist stencil typeface, created primarily for laser cutters:
All whitespaces are connected with the background, making it a lettering 
perfect for signs, jewelry, stencils and general cutting. 

It also comes with the additional, decorative style Brannboll Stencil Swash, 
which contains ten cool swashes to give the graphic extra expression. 

It has a very extensive lingual support, covering all European Latin scripts.
The font contains all characters you'll ever need, including all punctuation 
and numbers.
